### Problem I am trying to solve

Using Pandas to extract and analyse the information, visualise it, and look at different ways to analyse the risk of a stock, based on its performance history.

I took the top 5 stocks of United States and will try to analyze the data using ML model and predict if this reccession will hit the stock value as much if it dose it is a problem for this big companies and it will not be vise deciosion to invest in them as, those big companies already stated getting affected by recession and laying off so many jobs.

Here are the questions I’ll try to answer:

What was the change in a stock’s price over time?
What was the daily return of a stock?
What was the monthly return of a stock?
What was the weekly return of a stock?
What was the correlation between daily returns of different stocks?
What is the return of various stocks?

How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
How can we attempt to predict future stock behaviour?

# Outcome

We can see the TESLA stock there is recession going on it also hit the stock quite a bit in starting on 2023 as we can see in monthly figure but it again went uo and performming well and it also did'nt break the threshold. 
While there may be short-term challenges and fluctuations in Tesla's growth, the long-term outlook for the company remains positive. Its strong brand loyalty and expanding market for EVs give it a solid foundation for continued growth in the future.
